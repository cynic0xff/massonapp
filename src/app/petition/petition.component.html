<p>Having conceived a favorable opinion of the Ancient and Honorable Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons, and a sincere desire of
    being serviceable to my fellow creatures, unbiased by friends, and uninfluenced by mercenary motives, I do freely and voluntarily offer
    myself as a candidate for initiation into the mysteries of your time-honored institution, and if elected, will cheerfully conform to all the
    ancient and established usages and customs of the Fraternity, which I understand are based on the highest principles and moral precepts
    and incorporate no unseemly conduct. </p>
